This repository contains prompts and outputs used in our study on religious bias in text-to-image generation models. We systematically evaluate bias across multiple religions, using both mask-filling and prompt-completion methods. All prompt data and generated images are made publicly available to support transparency and reproducibility in future research.

## 📂 Contents

- `prompts/`: All prompts used for probing language models.
- `images/`: Generated images from text-to-image systems.

## 🔍 Objective

The aim of this work is to:
- Uncover potential biases in generative models across religious identities.
- Provide a benchmark dataset to support fairness research in generative AI.
- Highlight intersectional aspects like religion × gender × nationality × age group.
